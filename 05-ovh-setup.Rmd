# OVH Cloud VPS setup

The setup tutorial could be devided into five parts:
- OVHcloud Control Panel setup (reinstall OS)
- WHM & cPanel setup
- Secure your server
- Setup your domain
- Install dependencies & other settings

## OVHcloud Control Panel setup
### Reinstall OS
If you already have a VPS and want to have cPanel on it, you can reinstall the VPS from your OVHcloud Control Panel with the **“CentOS 7 - cPanel”** template (available only with a compatible VPS solution). After that, you will receive an email shortly with the username & password + cPanel login details.

### Setup fireware
In order to increase the VPS's security, we can go to IP

Set firewall here

## WHM & cPanel setup

This tutorial is adapted from [ovh cloud guide](https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/vps/cpanel/).

cPanel has been widely used for domain and web application management. We are using this as well. Unfortunately (or fortunately), it is not possible to setup using command line. There are two steps we need to set manually: whm setting, cpanel account creation.

### WHM manager

#### How to set up - link generation
Once you received the email with the unique link, please proceed to the link to do the initial setup.

The URL above allows you to log in without credentials (user and password) to your WHM manager.

However, the link sometimes expires soon. Alternatively, you can generate a new link by running `sudo whmlogin` (when you ssh in).

#### WHM agreement & namespace setting

Given the link, you will be able to access

Namespace setting (config your domain)

![Namespace-vps-name.vps.ovh.net](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xihajun/image/main/img/20220210175101.png)

#### set root password

Once you login into WHM, you will be able to setup a root password for future access.

![set-password](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xihajun/image/main/img/20220210174451.png)
Then you will be able to login with the username (root) & password. In the future, you will be able to access WHM here: 
<https://vps-name.vps.ovh.net:2087>

#### create a cPanel account

## Secure VPS
Change SSH port is highly recommended. We can change the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file

```{bash eval = FALSE}
 vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
```
![port 22](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xihajun/image/main/img/20220210175712.png)

We can change the Port 22 to whatever port you want (eg. 33), then restart the sshd
```{bash eval = FALSE}

sudo systemctl restart sshd
```

Now you will only be able to ssh using (eg. 33)

```{bash eval = FALSE}
ssh username@ip.add.r.ess -p 33
```

## Setup your domain

Go to the domain provider website and change the domain to

```
vps-id.vps.ovh.net
cdns.ovh.net
```
## Install dependencies & other settings

All you need is this git repo: <https://github.com/ss-lab-cancerunit/ovhcloud>

```{bash eval = FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/ss-lab-cancerunit/ovhcloud.git
cd ovhcloud
bash setup.sh
```
