You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). 1.1 Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. 1.2 Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, you’ll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. 1.3 Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book”, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["standard-operating-procedures.html", "Section 2 Standard Operating Procedures 2.1 A section", " Section 2 Standard Operating Procedures All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 2.1 A section All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively.

After that, you will receive an email shortly with the username &amp; password + cPanel login details. 8.1.2 Setup fireware In order to increase the VPS’s security, we can go to IP Set firewall here 8.2 WHM &amp; cPanel setup This tutorial is adapted from ovh cloud guide. cPanel has been widely used for domain and web application management. We are using this as well. Unfortunately (or fortunately), it is not possible to setup using command line. There are two steps we need to set manually: whm setting, cpanel account creation. 8.2.1 WHM manager 8.2.1.1 How to set up - link generation Once you received the email with the unique link, please proceed to the link to do the initial setup. The URL above allows you to log in without credentials (user and password) to your WHM manager. However, the link sometimes expires soon. Alternatively, you can generate a new link by running sudo whmlogin (when you ssh in). 8.2.1.2 WHM agreement &amp; namespace setting Given the link, you will be able to access WHM agreement Namespace setting (config your domain) Namespace-vps-name.vps.ovh.net 8.2.1.3 set root password Once you login into WHM, you will be able to setup a root password for future access. Then you will be able to login with the username (root) &amp; password. In the future, you will be able to access WHM here: https://vps-name.vps.ovh.net:2087 8.2.1.4 create a cPanel account You will be able to create new accounts here by filling all the details. Setup an account, details is in webserver channel Read more here https://docs.ovh.com/gb/en/vps/cpanel/. 8.3 Secure VPS Change SSH port is highly recommended. We can change the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config port 22 We can change the Port 22 to whatever port you want (eg. 33), then restart the sshd sudo systemctl restart sshd Now you will only be able to ssh using (eg. 33) ssh username@ip.add.r.ess -p 33 Read more here https://docs.cpanel.net/knowledge-base/security/tips-to-make-your-server-more-secure/. 8.4 Setup your domain Go to the domain provider website and change the domain to vps-id.vps.ovh.net cdns.ovh.net 8.5 Install dependencies &amp; other settings All you need is this git repo: https://github.com/ss-lab-cancerunit/ovhcloud git clone https://github.com/ss-lab-cancerunit/ovhcloud.git cd ovhcloud bash setup.sh "],["bookdown-tutorial-create-this-page.html", "Section 9 Bookdown Tutorial (Create-this-page) 9.1 Video Tutorial (in 10 mins) 9.2 GitHub action", " Section 9 Bookdown Tutorial (Create-this-page) 9.1 Video Tutorial (in 10 mins) I followed this YouTube video to create this page: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdSmYvbQkhs 9.2 GitHub action In order to automatically generate this bookdown page, we need to setup a github action.
